<h2>Sacred Prayer to Mother Surabhi</h2>


<p style="text-align: justify;">
Oh Mother Surabhi!<br><br>
You are the Mother of all cows.<br><br>
You sustain all life and all living entities.<br><br>
You provide shelter to those who have no shelter.<br><br>
You fulfill all desires.<br><br>
Your very presence brings all auspiciousness.<br><br>
You are the source and basis of all wealth.<br><br>
You are pure, attractive and aromatic.<br><br>
You bring one to the mode of goodness.<br><br>
You bring health, longevity and good fortune.<br><br>
You are our universal Mother!<br><br>
Without you we will have no mothers.<br><br>
Without you we will have no life.<br><br>
Without you will have no shelter.<br><br>
Without you we will have no hope.<br><br>
Without you we will have no happiness.<br><br>
Without you we will have no food.<br><br>
Without you will have no direction.<br><br>
Without you we will have no morality.<br><br>
Without you we will have no health.<br><br>
Without you we will become orphans.<br><br>
Please allow us to serve you.<br><br>
Please allow us to love you.<br><br>
Please allow us to worship you.<br><br>
Please allow us to be with you.<br><br>
