	<td>Make Vrindavan Villages</td><td>This small booklet is meant to serve as a general introduction to some of the basic concepts of varnasrama:dharma. For those unfamiliar with the principles of varnasrama:dharma, the book entitled "Varnasrama Education : An Introductory Manual" [soon to be published]will help clarify the question. In essence, the subject matter deals with both the topic of education as well as social and spiritual upliftment through a well established and scientifically planned educational system and social structure which encompass all spheres and all dimensions of life. Unless we understand these basic and standard traditional Vedic principles and until we become convinced of the importance and urgency to establish varnasrama:dharma, no educational system and no social structure will succeed in bringing about the individual and social stability so much needed in our present day severely misguided society.</td></tr>

Here, we can understand his desire, mission, practical insights, predictions, experience and realizations shared in a very frank manner. What makes the book very lovely is the editing work by the dedicated team. The team formed in 1992 by ISKCON GBC was called :’Farm Research Committee’ and was commissioned to study Srila Prabhupada’s instructions on agriculture and cow protection. The team realized that to research instructions on agriculture and cow protection is to ultimately research instructions on Varnasrama.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Indigenous Cows & Exotic Cows</td><td>It is exciting to know who was the cow who participated in Lord Krsna’s pastimes, or who did severe penance to please the Lord or who appeared from the churning of the ocean. Are all the cows alike? Holy scriptures discriminate, as does Science – Bos Indicus and Bos Taurus. The book throws light on these aspects while discussing the different existing indigenous cow breeds of India; differences between indigenous cows and exotic cows; and difference between buffalo milk and cow milk. It gives both scientific and Vedic insight into the subject. It is likely to inspire love for mother cow with intelligence without generating negative feelings towards non:indigenous cows as the latter have their own place in the ecological set up. It is likely to help and guide the government to annul policies that have harmed our own indigenous cows and gomata and also help formulate policies which will help her from getting extinct.</td>

<td>Foundational Pillars Of Education</td>
	<td>This book centers on knowledge and education, in particular the relevancy, effectiveness, objectives and future of traditional educational systems. Traditional education by nature and by definition forms the pillars, the "Foundational Pillars of Education", of an ideal and perfect society. Without such an education the society remains unstable, unpredictable, at times dangerously chaotic and thus always ever changing. Looking at modern education, or any education that is devoid of these foundational concepts and principles, we can understand how critical and urgent the need to reintroduce such standard knowledge, training and education is. These perennial teachings were taught and continue to be practiced in traditional Gurukulas (home of the guru or spiritual master) and Pondok Pesantren (residence for practicing students) as we see respectively in India and Indonesia.</td>
