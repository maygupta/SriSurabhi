<strong>Indigenous Cows : </strong>
All native varieties of Indian Cows are called Indigenous Cows. 


<strong>Exotic cows :</strong>
All the Cows of countries other than India and who do not possess the attributes of Indian Cows are called Exotic cows.
<br>
e.g. Jersey, Holstein Friesian, Ayrshire etc.
