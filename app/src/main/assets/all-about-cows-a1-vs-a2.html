Ahimsa milk is guilt free milk taken from cows who are protected and loved throughout their natural life span. Their calves too are not separated or killed after their birth.

In addition to the milk controversy regarding "ahimsa milk" and "non ahimsa milk", there is also a serious controversy over milk that is called A1 and A2 milk. There seems to be a need for more research in both of these issues, but there is sufficient concern to direct us towards taking a close look at these two matters. For those not familiar with A1 or A2 Category milk, we refer you to a book published called "THE DEVIL IN THE MILK" by author Dr. Keith Woodford, Professor Of Farm Management and Agri-business at Lincoln University In New Zealand.

<strong>"The Devil In the Milk"</strong>

A1 or A2 ?  How Beta-Caseins are changing the Dairy Industry 
<br><br>
There's a devil in the milk, says agricultural scientist Keith Woodford, and it has little to do with production methods. Woodford's startling thesis, backed up by a pile of research, is that a mutation many years ago created an aberrant protein in some European cows, called A1 cows to set them aside from all other cows, which are called A2. As a result, the milk from these cows has been linked to a host of maladies, including Type 1 diabetes, autism and heart disease. 
<br><br>
Still virtually unknown in this country, the A1-A2 question is prominent enough in New Zealand, where Woodford lives and works, to have spurred public controversy and the creation of a successful company that markets only A2 milk, the a2 Corporation. For growing numbers of Americans who have noticed that milk seems to attack their systems even though they are lactose-tolerant, Woodford's work, collected in his book, Devil in the Milk, offers vital illumination.
