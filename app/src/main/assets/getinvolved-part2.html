1.      Srila Prabhupada expected us to make the transition back to an
agrarian based lifestyle, which is the standard and the more natural way to
live Krishna consciousness for the vast majority of people, including most
of our devotees.<br><br>

"Who is producing food grain? But they are known as vaisya. What kind of
vaisya? There is no brahminical culture; there is no brain. There is no
ksatriya who can give you protection. There are so many defects.<br><br>

So if you want to remodel your life, the society, the human society,
nationally or internationally-everything is spoken here, international-then
you have to take to the advice of Krishna. This is the purpose of Krishna
consciousness movement: wholesale, thorough, overhauling of the human
society. We have not manufactured anything, concocted things. It is very
scientific. If you actually want to fulfill the mission of your life, then
you have to take to this advice of Bhagavad gita, very scientific and spoken
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without any defects."

the Previous Acaryas<br><br>

2.      Srila Prabhupada wanted us to introduce the varnasrama system
primarily based in villages where one can factually learn to be
self-sufficient.<br><br>

3.      Srila Prabhupada, while certainly wanting us to train people in
Krishna consciousness everywhere, was not satisfied that we simply develop
our congregations in the cities, but rather wanted our devotees and
congregation not engaged in front line preaching to move out of the cities
and relocate in a more natural, more sustainable environment that will
facilitate our practice of Krishna consciousness. Cities are meant to be our
preaching basis while the country is meant to be our living basis.<br><br>

There are innumerable opportunities for one and all to get-involved in the
mission of Daiva Varnasrama and there is a need to engage various
individuals, at whatever level may be suitable for them and in whatever
activity they may be inclined or qualified to perform.<br><br>

To provide such opportunities to devotees having some affinity, interest and
desire to help develop some particular aspect of Varnasrama Dharma,
IDVM-India has identified 15 "Service Categories" that one can take up in
order to participate in fulfilling Srila Prabhupada's unfulfilled mission.<br><br>

The categories listed below provide an initial choice of possible
engagements for interested persons (more can be added or amended).  All such
services are purely voluntary and should be performed essentially for the
pleasure of the Lord and His devotees.  More than one service category can
be chosen also.<br><br>

Each "Service Category" is described under their sub-divisions of: 1)
Definition, 2) Duties, 3) Qualifications and 4) Application.: (more details
