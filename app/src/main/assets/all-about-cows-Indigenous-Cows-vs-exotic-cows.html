<strong>Indigenous Cows</strong>
All native varieties of Indian cows are called Indigenous Cows

<br><Br>
<strong>Exotic Cows</strong>
All the cows of countries other than India and who do not possess the attributes of Indian cows are called exotic cows

e.g. Jersey, Holstein Friesian, Ayrshire etc.
<br><br>
However, the differences between desi cow breeds and genetically altered breeds are not just limited to physical parameters. The differences also extend to the nutritional and medicinal derivatives obtained from these breeds. The following table gives a summary of the differences between these two breeds.
