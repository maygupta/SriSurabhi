    <string name="panchgyana_desc_text">Panchgavya in Sanskrit means a blend of five products obtained from cow and holds an important place in Ayurvedic medicine.
        It is basically a concoction of cow’s dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee. It doesn’t only heal one’s body but also lifts up depressed mental states thereby
        providing positivity, longevity and magnetic charisma. Due to such benefits of Panchgavya, it is often called as a divine elixir by Ayurvedacharyas. Ancient
        scriptures like bhel sanhita, kashyap sanhita, charak sanhita, sushrut sanhita, gad nigrah, ras tantra saar and yog ratnakar granth hail about glory of
        the mix of cow’s five essences – the Panchgavya.\n\n
        The Ayurvedacharyas prescribe Panchgavya as the apex of total health, both physiological as well as psychological. Panchgavya therapy also called as Cowpathy
        has become popular world wide.</string>

    <string name="cow_dung">Cow Dung</string>
    <string name="panchgyana_cows_dung_text"> Cow dung is anti-septic. It has anti-bacterial and fungicidal action. Thus a filtrate of the suspension made by thoroughly mixing cow dung and water
        forms one of the main ingredients of skin ointments, which are useful in serious skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema and gangrene. Her dung is also an
        effective disinfectant for floors and walls that even protects from radioactive rays. Not just that, 1 Kg of Indian Cow’s Dung mixed with Biomass
        produces 20-25 Kg of Bio Fertilizer. And 1 Indian Cow’s dung on an average can produce enough electricity to light two 100-watt light bulbs for 24
        hours a day.</string>
    <string name="cow_urine">Cow Urine</string>
    <string name="panchgyana_cow_urine_text"> <b><i></i></b> Cow’s urine has been acclaimed by Ayurveda as a therapeutic. It has medicinal properties as well as metaphysical benefits.
        Today, it is globally acknowledged that cow’s urine can cure more than 3000 diseases. Cancer, diabetes, blood pressure, asthma, psoriasis, eczema, ringworm, itching, heart attack,
        blockage in arteries, fits, piles, prostrate, arthritis, migraine, thyroid, ulcer, acidity, constipation, eosinophilia, cough,  phlegm, varicose veins, gynaecological problems and
        ear and nose problems to name a few. It is also practically observed that spraying drops of cow urine over floor keeps evil spirits away.</string>

    <string name="cow_milk">Cow Milk</string>
    <string name="panchgyana_cow_milk_text"> According to Ayurveda, cow milk provides special and unique nutrition that cannot be derived from any other type of food. Cow milk, when digested
        properly, nourishes all the tissues, promotes balanced emotions, and helps to balance all the doshas. It is one of the most important foods to promote
        Ojas (the force that maintains life). Indian Cow produces A2 quality Milk which contains Beta Casein Protein that strengthens the digestive as well as
        the neurological system unlike the A1 Milk produced by Jersey Cows that contain an opiate called betacasomorphine and thus causes brain illnesses such
        as autism, schizophrenia etc.</string>

    <string name="cow_ghee">Ghee</string>
    <string name="panchgyana_cow_ghee_text"> In Ayurveda, cow\'s Ghee is believed to be the best for human consumption. It is full of nutritive qualities and an ideal diet for these heart patients
        who suffer due to excessive cholesterol in their blood. Its regular consumption enhances physical and mental strength, keeps the body healthy and
        increases the potency of the body. It is not only nutritive, but also helps in taking out the impurities from the body. It enhances eyesight, keeps
        muscles and tendons healthy, and bone sturdy yet supple.</string>

    <string name="cow_dahi">Dahi</string>
    <string name="panchgyana_cow_dahi_text">Dahi: Dahi (Curd) is a by-product of cow milk. The Sanskrit name is for curd is dahi. All the leading practitioners of Ayurveda, including Charaka and Sushruta,
        have written on its qualities and usefulness. It is considered as one of the most wholesome food items throughout the world. Curd has its therapeutic
        value in many diseases. It has been described as a tonic and is credited with the properties that prevent premature aging. Curd also brings relief to
        patients of diarrhoea and dysentery and is recommended in chronic specific and non-specific colitis.
Panchagavya is also a traditional method, used to safeguard plants and soil micro-organisms and to increase plant production. Panchagavya application is
        found to be more profitable than recommended fertilizer application and chemical spray.
